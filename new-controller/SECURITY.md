# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

**Do not** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

Send security reports to: [maintainer-email]

**Please include:**
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll respond within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: Security team investigates the report
3. **Resolution**: Fix developed and tested
4. **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure with reporter

### Security Updates

Security fixes are released as patch versions (e.g., v1.0.1). We'll publish a security advisory with:
- Vulnerability description
- Impact assessment
- Fix details
- Upgrade instructions

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated
- **Code Review**: Review for security implications
- **Testing**: Include security test cases
- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets or credentials

### For Users

- **Image Security**: Use specific image tags, not `latest`
- **RBAC**: Follow principle of least privilege
- **Network Policies**: Restrict controller network access
- **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate resource constraints
- **Updates**: Keep controller updated

## Threat Model

### Potential Risks

- **Container Escape**: Controller runs with limited privileges
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Resource limits prevent DoS
- **Information Disclosure**: No sensitive data in logs/metrics
- **Privilege Escalation**: RBAC prevents unauthorized actions

### Mitigations

- **Security Context**: Non-root execution, read-only filesystem
- **Network Security**: Limited port exposure
- **Access Control**: Namespace-scoped RBAC
- **Input Validation**: CRD schema validation

## Dependencies

We use automated tools to monitor dependencies:

- **Dependabot**: Weekly dependency updates
- **Security Scanning**: Container and code scanning
- **SBOM**: Software Bill of Materials generated

## Container Security

Controller images follow security best practices:

- **Base Image**: Distroless for minimal attack surface
- **User**: Non-root execution
- **Filesystem**: Read-only root filesystem
- **Capabilities**: Dropped capabilities
- **Seccomp**: Runtime default profile

## Incident Response

In case of security incidents:

1. **Immediate Response**: Assess and contain
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify cause and scope
3. **Fix Development**: Develop and test fix
4. **Communication**: Notify affected users
5. **Prevention**: Implement preventive measures

## Compliance

This project follows security standards:

- Kubernetes security best practices
- Container security guidelines
- OWASP recommendations for Kubernetes

## Contact

For security concerns, contact the maintainers directly rather than creating public issues.
